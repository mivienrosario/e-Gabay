# e-Gabay
Developed with Android Studio using Flutter/DART. The app adapts various different evidence-based techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, mindfulness, positive psychology, and psychoeducation. These techniques are integrated into three simple features namely audio guides, journal writing, and articles. A simple assessment tool is featured as well to quickly determine the stress level of the user, which can then be logged in the journals. However, the app should not be regarded as a cure for stress and requires more research, especially for its efficacy. Seeking professional help is always recommended in the app.

## Abstract
Inadequate support, numerous school works, or adaptation challenges are some of the common causes of academic stress and may lead to poor mental health. This study aimed to find different interventions for managing stress, what features to be included in the proposed mobile application, and the level of usability of the developed mobile application.
The mobile application was developed through Rapid Application Development methodology. The researchers collaborated with the Guidance Office of the department of College of Information Technology (CIT) and surveyed 51 CIT students in order to measure the level of usability of the developed mobile application: e-Gabay. 
The findings show that guided intervention, writing down oneâ€™s thoughts, and mental literacy are possible ways to manage stress. Usability test results show that the developed mobile application is usable.
